# garageDoor

This garage door was written in C with the Keil ÂµVision IDE. The door utilizes several communication interfaces to allow the different peripherals to speak to each other. The garage door uses a temperature sensor to automatically open in hot temperatures and close in cold temperatures. It is also connected to a terminal on a separate laptop via Bluetooth that can respond to asynchronous commands.
